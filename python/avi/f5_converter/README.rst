Avi F5 Config Converter
=======================
`Avi F5 Config Converter  <https://github.com/avinetworks/sdk/releases/tag/latest>`_
is a Python Package that can convert F5 configurations into Avi Configurations.

F5 converter takes input as F5 configuration outputs Avi configuration in JSON
format which can be uploaded to Avi Vantage Controller for migrating
applications and settings.

There are two ways to input F5 configuration

#. **Command Line**: Input F5 configuration on the command line or,

#. **Download from F5 box**: Converter downloads the configuration and
   profile defaults from the F5 box.

Upon successful run the converter outputs the results in **ouput** directory
with following contents:

- **ConversionStatus.csv**: Status of the conversion. It is a CSV file with
  each row representing F5 configuration object and its migration status and
  corresponding Avi configuration.

- **Output.json**: This is ouput of the migrated configuration in Avi Vantage
  configuration JSON format. This configuration can be uploaded to the Avi
  Vantage controller.

- **converter.log**: This is troubleshooting log for F5 Converter useful for
  debugging and logging purpose.


F5 Object Migration status fields
---------------------------------

+-----------+--------+----------+----------+------------+---------+---------+----------+--------+
| F5 Config | status | skipped  | Indirect | Not        | User    | Skipped | Avi      |        |
|           |        | settings | mapping  | Applicable | Ignored |         | Defaults | Object |
+-----------+--------+----------+----------+------------+---------+---------+----------+--------+
+-----------+--------+----------+----------+------------+---------+---------+----------+--------+

 - **Status**: Overall status of the migration. If it is "successful"
   implies it was completely migrated to AVI Vantage and admin can expect
   similar behavior in Avi Vantage as it was in F5 Box. A "partial" status
   implies that not all the settings within an F5 object could be fully
   converted to Avi configuration. Converter provides list of the skipped
   settings as part of the status of that object. The status can also be
   "skipped" which implies that the F5 configuration could not be migrated.

 - **Skipped**: List of field settings that were skipped as they are not
   supported in Avi.

 - **Indirect mapping**: These settings are indirectly mapped to Avi
   features. Please refer to Avi website for more details.

 - **Not Applicable**: These settings are not applicable to Avi. Eg.
   hardware settings etc.

 - **User Ignored**: These settings were ignored by the admins

 - **Skipped for defaults**: These settings came from F5 configuration
   defaults. These have been mapped to Avi's default settings.

 - **Avi Object**: Converter Avi JSON object.
