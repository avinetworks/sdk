It is only used for exceptional situations where crashes of se_dp processes are acceptable. The behavior of the system if this time is exceeded depends on two other configuration settings, the WAF policy mode and the WAF failure mode. In WAF policy mode 'Detection', the request is allowed and flagged for both failure mode 'Closed' and 'Open'. In enforcement node, 'Closed' means the request is rejected, 'Open' means the request is allowed and flagged. Irrespective of these settings, no subsequent WAF rules of this or other phases will be executed once the maximum execution time has been exceeded. Allowed values are 0-5000.
