        Examples
        - **virtualservice_example_1**: To create a basic virtualservice object that has both http and https enabled
          ```json
            {u'services': [{u'port': 80}, {u'enable_ssl': True, u'port': 443}], u'vip': [{u'ip_address': {u'type': u'V4', u'addr': u'10.10.2.28'}}], u'name': u'production_vs'}
          ```

        - **virtualservice_example_ipamdns_infoblox**: Create a basic virtualservice object that requires IP to be auto-allocated and DNS record to be registered. @Assumptions: - This example assumes the virtualservice being created is part of a Cloud with Infoblox as IPAM & DNS provider - On Infoblox server - "10.10.10.0/24" is configured for VIPs - "prod.corp" is configured as zone
          ```json
            {u'vip': [{u'subnet': {u'ip_addr': {u'type': u'V4', u'addr': u'10.10.10.0'}, u'mask': 24}, u'auto_allocate_ip': True}], u'name': u'production_vs', u'fqdn': u'production_vs.prod.corp'}
          ```

        - **virtualservice_example_ipamdns_internal**: Create a basic virtualservice object that requires IP to be auto-allocated and DNS record to be registered. @Assumptions: - This example assumes the virtualservice being created is part of a Cloud with Internal IPAM & DNS provider - On Avi - Network object containing free IPs from "10.10.10.0/24" is already created - "prod.corp" is configured as a domain name in DNS provider config in Avi
          ```json
            {u'vip': [{u'subnet': {u'ip_addr': {u'type': u'V4', u'addr': u'10.10.10.0'}, u'mask': 24}, u'auto_allocate_ip': True, u'network_ref': u'/api/network/network-042975ea-376d-4e59-b8da-1b299be51eb1'}], u'name': u'production_vs', u'fqdn': u'production_vs.prod.corp'}
