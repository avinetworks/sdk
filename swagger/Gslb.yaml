This is useful in network deployments where the VIPs/VS(es) are reachable only from certain sites. A typical scenario is a firewall between two GSLB sites. User may want to run health monitor probes from sites on either side of the firewall so that each designated site can derive a datapath view of the reachable members. If the health monitor proxies are not configured, then the default behavior is to run health monitor probes from all the active sites. Field introduced in 17.1.1."
